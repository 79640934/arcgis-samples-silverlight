The sample illustrates how to resample tiles in an ArcGIS Server tiled map service that contain no data.  ArcGIS Server tiled map services are unique in the API in that the image source is downloaded to the client prior to rendering.  As a result, you can use the TileLoaded event to determine when an image for a tile has loaded and gain access to the image source. 

Once you have access to the tile image source, you need to determine if the tile contains no data.  In this case, the size of a no data tile remains constant for the ArcGIS tiled map service being accessed.  When a tile of that size is returned, we can assume its a no data tile.  The size can, and often does, differ depending on the service you are using.  Another option may involve interrogating the content of a no data tile, such as checking the color of a specific pixel.  In either case, there is a chance that a valid tile with data is returned and matches the evaluation for a no data tile.  Note, Silverlght does not have access to response headers, so checking for an etag is not possible.

Once a no data tiled is found, work up the stack of tile levels to find the a tile that contains data. There are a number of variables to consider, such the resolution of tile levels.  Once a tile with data is found, use WebClient to make a web request to download the image source.  Since we've kept a reference to the original tile image source via TileLoadEventArgs.ImageSource, create a Bitmap for the tile with data, define a location, and render. 

In this sample, when a tile is resampled, the scale multiplier is added to the tile as text.  Remove the appropriate line in the OpenReadCompleted event handler to remove this text from resampled tiles.
