This sample demonstrates how to use the rotation properties on a renderer to define how symbols are rotated.  With ArcGIS Server 10.2, feature layer metadata in map or feature services provide rotation parameters for symbols within a layer.  If present, the FeatureLayer class in the API will honor it.  However, to override or define rotation parameters for feature or graphics layers on the client, use rotation properties on the renderer.  Use RotationType to define whether the rotation values (eg. value) are geographic (0 deg oriented north, rotate clockwise) or arithmetic (0 deg oriented east, rotate counter-clockwise).  The RotationExpression property represents either a constant value or a field which contains the rotation value; in either case it should be a number between 0-360.  Complex rotation expressions beyond a single field definition are not supported.   

Note, the AngleAlignment of symbols within the renderer must be set to "Map" to match the default angle alignment of symbols in an ArcGIS map or feature service.
