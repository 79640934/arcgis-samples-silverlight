This sample demonstrates how to use the IdentityManager to provide access to a secured service. The map contains an ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer and a secured ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer, and IdentityManager is listening for any challenges for credentials. When the Map tries to access the secure service, the IdentityManager.ChallengeMethod, in this case the Challenge method, is executed. In this sample, the Challenge method uses a prompt to request a username and password from the user, and then passes those to the IdentityManager.GenerateCredetialAsync. If a valid username and password are provided, IdentityManager will have the information to access the secured service and it will load. If invalid information is provided, the IdentityManager will reprompt up to 3 times for a single service (here tracked using a dictionary of URLs and counts of challenge attempts).
