This sample demonstrates adding data in a secure WebMap document housed via ArcGIS Online (http://www.arcgis.com) in a Silverlight application. The user inputs a web map, along with their user name and password, to authorize access to the web map. The input is made into a URL used to generate a token from ArcGIS.com, and once a token is returned it is added to the WebMap request using the WebMap.Token property. Then the WebMap.GetMapAsync method call takes a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the WebMap service provided by ArcGIS Online to obtain the geographic data layers. The WebMap’s GetMapCompletedEventArgs.Map Property is used to add a Map Class to the Silverlight application for visual display.
