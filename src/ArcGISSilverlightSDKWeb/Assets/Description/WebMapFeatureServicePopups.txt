This sample demonstrates how to retrieve contents from a webmap on ArcGIS Online that contains feature service layer with pop-ups.  Since feature service layers are represented as feature layers in the map, popup templates are applied to map tips configured on the layer.  A set of attached properties on the Document class enable access to feature layer properties within a webmap.  This includes popup template details provided as a data template via the PopupTemplate attached property.   Attribute values of features in the feature layer can be used to populate the data template.  In this sample, a feature layer represents a feature service layer on which pop-ups are configured.  You can choose to show attribute data as map tips or in an info window using the PopupTemplate data template to define display.
