This sample demonstrates adding data in the KML format to a Map control. The KmlLayer Class extracts features from a KML source and renders them as a graphics layer. The samples uses the ProxyUrl Property to demonstrate how a proxy service brokers web requests between the Silverlight client and the KML file. Use a proxy service when the KML file is not hosted on a site that provides a cross domain policy file (clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml).
