This sample illustrates how to use the WebTiledLayer to display tiled map services in the Web Mercator spatial reference (wkid:102100) by obtaining map tiles (images) from a url.  Tiles are organized in a level, row, and column structure and can be available on more than one subdomain.  The template for a web tiled layer replaces the level, row, and column variables with values defined by the API when the layer is displayed in a map.   Tile requests can be distributed across multiple subdomains to reduce the time to retrieve all map tiles for a given map extent and scale.  Use the SubDomains property to set the subDomain variable in the template url.   

Note, proper attribution is normally required when using a tiled map service.  Be sure to review the license terms and conditions when referencing a web tiled layer in your map and application.
