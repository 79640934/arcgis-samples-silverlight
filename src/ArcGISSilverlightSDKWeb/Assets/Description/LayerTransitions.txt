This sample demonstrates a technique for creating a smooth visual transition when changing the visibility of a layer.  The static CompositionTarget class represents the display surface of a Silverlight application.  The CompositionTarget.Rendering event is used to determine when a frame of visuals are rendered.  This sample uses the Rendering event to change layer visibility and opacity and create a smooth visual fade from one layer to another.
