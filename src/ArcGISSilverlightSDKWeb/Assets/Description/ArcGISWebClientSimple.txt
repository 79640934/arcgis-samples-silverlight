To use the sample, enter a url to an ArcGIS Server endpoint (e.g. http://myhost.com/arcgis/rest/services) and click the "Get Services" button.  All map services will be returned in a Listbox.  Select a map service in the list to view it in the map control.  

This sample demonstrates how to use the ArcGISWebClient class to manage raw web requests to ArcGIS resources (such as ArcGIS Server, ArcGIS Online, and Portal for ArcGIS).  The class is built to switch between GET and POST depending on the length of a request, use GZIP to streamline downloads, handle decode errors from ArcGIS Server, use IdentityManager to access secure resources, disable client caching, or set a proxy URL.   In this sample, ArcGISWebClient is used return a list of services and the metadata for a selected map service.  In both case, JSON is returned from the server.  The OpenReadAsync method returns a stream and deserialized the response into a set of classes defined by a data contract.  The DownloadStringAsync method is used to return map service metadata and is parsed to find a specific value to determine if a map service is tiled or dynamic.  DownloadString can be used for responses you know will return a string, while OpenRead returns a more generic stream (which may contain string data).
