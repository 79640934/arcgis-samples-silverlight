This sample demonstrates how to create a graphics layer from ArcGIS JSON using the FeatureSet.FromJson() static method.  The ArcGIS JSON string included in the code-behind contains two features which are converted into graphics and displayed in the map using a green marker symbol.  Existing graphics collections within graphics layers or feature layers can be converted into ArcGIS JSON using the FeatureSet.ToJson() method.  A feature layer in the map contains a set of cities symbolized using a red marker symbol.  The graphics collection of the feature layer is serialized to ArcGIS JSON and displayed in the textbox below the map.
