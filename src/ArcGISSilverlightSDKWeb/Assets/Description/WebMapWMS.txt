This sample demonstrates adding data in a WebMap document housed via ArcGIS Online (http://www.arcgis.com) in a Silverlight application. The WebMap.GetMapAsync Method call takes a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the WebMap service provided by ArcGIS Online to obtain the geographic data layers. The WebMap's GetMapCompletedEventArgs.Map Property is used to add a Map Class to the Silverlight application for visual display. The map loaded in this sample includes an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) WMS layer. The sample also uses the ProxyUrl Property to demonstrate how a proxy service brokers web requests between the Silverlight client and the ArcGIS Online service that exposes a WebMap document. Use a proxy service when the WebMap document is not hosted on a site that provides a cross domain policy file (clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml).
