This sample demonstrates how to use a relationship query to display information from a related table for the selected features. Clicking on the map highlight a set of wells near the clicked point.  Select a well from the list to display related features (tops).  The object id of the well is used in the relationship query to return 0 or many related records displayed in the data grid.    

Note that the code requires a relationshipId. Feature layers can have more than one relationship and each relationship is identified by a unique identifier. You can use the Services Directory to find the relationship id.
