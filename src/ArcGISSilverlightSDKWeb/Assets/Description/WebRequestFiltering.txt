This sample demonstrates how to intercept, filter, and modify parameters in a web request.  The WebRequest.RegisterPrefix static method is used to register a url and a web request descendant to service requests to the url.  Visually this sample will not change.  To see the behavior in action, use a network utility (eg Fiddler) to capture network traffic.   Upon initial load the custom parameter "myParameterName=1" is appended on a request to get service info for the dynamic map service.  After the layer is initialized, the custom parameter is changed to "myParameterName=2" and appended to subsequent requests to the map service (eg generating a map image).  Click the button in the UI to change the custom parameter to "myParameterName=3" and subsequent requests include the updated parameter value.  This demonstrates how a custom parameter and value can be altered during the lifetime of the app.   Use this as a guide for filtering and manipulating web requests within your application.
