This sample demonstrates the Legend control and its support for KML and WMS layers. The Legend control displays the symbology of specified Layers with text explanations of what the symbols mean in a map an organized in a tree view hierarchy. The specific Layers that are displayed in the Legend control are controlled by what is specified in the LayersIDs Property.

For this sample, the LayerItemsMode Property is set to 'Tree' meaning all sub-layers and groups will automatically be displayed in the Legend control. Users are free to collapse the symbology with text descriptions of the Legend for individual layers and sub-layers.
