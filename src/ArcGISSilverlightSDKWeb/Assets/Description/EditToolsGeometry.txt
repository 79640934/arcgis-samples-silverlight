This sample demonstrates using the ESRI.ArcGIS.Client.EditGeometry class for explicit control over the editing experience of an existing graphic.  A set of methods initiate actions to start, stop, cancel, undo, and redo edits on a graphic's geometry.  Symbols to represent vertices and handles (used to rotate, scale, and move geometry) can be explicitly defined.  The GeometryEdit event can be used to track each action that occurs.  Snapping to other graphic geometry is supported.  If the graphics are associated with an editable feature layer hosted by a feature service, edits will be pushed back to the server upon completion.     

To use the sample, click on the polygon or line feature and begin editing.  EditGeometry only supports polygon or line geometry.  Some code logic to edit the geometry of an existing point feature is included, but it does not leverage EditGeometry and is merely meant to provide an example of simple editing of point geometry can be accomplished.
