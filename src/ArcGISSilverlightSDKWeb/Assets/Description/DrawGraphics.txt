This sample demonstrates adding graphics through user interaction.  The sample uses the Toolkit's Toolbar control and the Draw object to provide graphic drawing tools.  In the sample's code-behind, an event handler for the Toolbar's ItemClicked event is used to parse which tool was clicked and initialize the Draw object accordingly.

Tick the "Click on geometry to edit" check box and click on geometry in the map to edit vertices, scale, and rotate.
