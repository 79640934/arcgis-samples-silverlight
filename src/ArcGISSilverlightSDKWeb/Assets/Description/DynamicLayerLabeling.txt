This sample demonstrates how to use the LabelClass to define label options, such as field, filter, color, font, and placement dynamically.  In general, each point in the map represents a census block.  The size of the point is proportional to the population in the block.  Labels are rendered on the server (in the map image created dynamically on the server) using a population field where the color and size of the label represents the population value.   Set the label placement property (via the combo box) to change where the label is displayed relative to the census block point.  Note as you pan and zoom around the map, label locations will change and labels for points with higher population values will take precendence.
