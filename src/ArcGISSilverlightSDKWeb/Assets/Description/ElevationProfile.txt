This sample demonstrates how to use ArcGIS Online's world elevation profile geoprocessing service to generate an elevation profile from a user defined path on the surface of the earth and provide an interactive, visual chart of the results.  Use the draw tools to create a line (path).  When complete, an elevation profile is generated and results are displayed in a chart.  The chart control is included with the Silverlight Toolkit (http://silverlight.codeplex.com/).  Hover over the line in the chart to see the elevation and distance from the start of the line at that location.  The respective location is also displayed on the line in the map.
