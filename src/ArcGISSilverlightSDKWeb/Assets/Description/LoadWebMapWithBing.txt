This sample demonstrates adding data in a WebMap document housed via ArcGIS Online (http://www.arcgis.com) in a Silverlight application. The WebMap.GetMapAsync Method call takes a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the WebMap service provided by ArcGIS Online to obtain the geographic data layers. The WebMap’s GetMapCompletedEventArgs.Map Property is used to add a Map Class to the Silverlight application for visual display. Since some of the geographic data layers used by the WebMap document consist of data provided by Microsoft Bing Map services, setting the WebMap.BingToken Property is required.
