This sample demonstrates how to use the ArcGIS Portal REST API to search public web maps within a map extent, termed bounding box by the Portal API.  Enter a query string and navigate the map to set the map extent within which to search for web maps.  Web maps matching the search parameters are listed with a thumbnail and title.  The location of each web map is displayed in the map control as a graphic that represents the center point of a web map's extent.  Click on a graphic to select it and view the web map details in the Listbox.  Click on the web map item in the Listbox to zoom to and select the respective graphic in the map.
