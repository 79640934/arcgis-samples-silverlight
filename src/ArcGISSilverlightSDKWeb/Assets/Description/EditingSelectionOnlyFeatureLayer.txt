The Sample demonstrates editing a FeatureLayer in Selection Only mode. 

In a selection only feature layer features are queried from the feature layer based on the selected extent. 
So to be able to edit selected features, it is required that feature are selected and are available at client side. 

To use this sample, use selection tool to select feature(s) from WildFirePoint and WildFire polygon layer. Perform edits and clear the selection. 
After the edits are saved, WildFire ArcGIS Dynamic MapService should be refreshed to reflect the new updates.
