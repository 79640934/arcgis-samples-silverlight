This sample demonstrates how to use the custom Server Object Extension (SOE) hosted by ArcGIS Server.  The SOE is accessible via the ArcGIS Server REST API.  A web request is manually constructed by populating argument\value pairs to match parameters defined by the SOEs REST schema (discoverable via the ArcGIS Server Services Directory).   The response from the SOE contains string data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  There are a number of techniques for handling JSON in Silverlight, two of which are listed here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc197957(v=vs.95).aspx.   This sample shows how to DataContractJsonSerializer to process and use JSON in the response.  The SOE operation utilized in this example returns the elevation for a specific location on the surface of the earth.
