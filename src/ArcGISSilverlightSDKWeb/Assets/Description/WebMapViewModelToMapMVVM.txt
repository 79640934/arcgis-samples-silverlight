This samples demonstrates how to use the WebMapViewModel view class in an MVVM based application.   The goal of the sample is to abstract visual elements in the view (xaml) from business logic in the view model (code).  To create a WebMapViewModel requires a web map and a portal.   WebMapViewModel implements INotifyProperty changed, which means it's properties can participate in binding scenarios.  In this example, the WebMapViewModel.Layers collection, populated from a web map, is easily bound to the Map's layers collection in the view.  On the other hand, since the Map's Extent property is not directly bindable, an attached property (MapInitialExtent) is used.  Since a web map maintains an initial extent, when the WebMapViewModel.InitialExtent property is set the user control's MapInitialExtent dependency property handles the change and zooms the map to the initial extent.
