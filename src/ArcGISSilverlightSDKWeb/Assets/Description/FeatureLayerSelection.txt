This sample demonstrates selecting individual features, using a rectangle, in an ESRI.ArcGIS.Client FeatureLayer. Buttons for selecting new features, adding more features to the existing selection set, removing features from the existing selection set, and clearing all the features in the selection set are provided. The 'Keyboard' button enables the use of keyboard shortcuts to select features.  Hold the Ctrl key and drag mouse to add new features to existing selection.  Hold the Shift key and drag mouse to remove features from existing selection.  The 'Continuous Action' checkbox enables not having to click a button each time for a subsequent user action when checked on. All selection events are configured as part of the ESRI.ArcGIS.Client Editor class in the XAML. Points in the FeatureLayer are rendered when selected using a StaticResource dictionary with a defined MarkerSymbol. MapTips on the FeatureLayer are provided to display attributes for a particular feature when the mouse is hovered over a selection.
