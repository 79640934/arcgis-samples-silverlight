This sample illustrates how to set the angle properties for symbols.  The Angle property defines the angle value, between 0-360.  The AngleAlignment property defines the orientation of the angle value.  Alignment to the map means the angle of the symbol is oriented to the map where 0 degrees represents north.  As the map rotates, the symbol rotates to maintain it's angle with respect to the map.   Alignment to the screen means the angle of the symbol is oriented to the screen where 0 degrees represents to the top of the screen.   As the map rotates, the symbol does not rotate to maintain it's angle with respect to the screen.
