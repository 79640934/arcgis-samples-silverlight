This sample illustrates how to use the task async pattern to write more manageable application code while still leveraging asynchronous capabilities.  Compare this sample with the Driving Directions sample (RoutingDirections.xaml) that uses the traditional event based pattern for handling asynchronous calls.  In general, the task async pattern requires less code and the flow of execution through the code emulates a more synchronous experience.  There are three asynchronous calls when directions a requested: geocode from address, geocode the to address, then solve the route.  Note the async and await keywords, the use of a cancellation token to cancel an operation, and the use to try\catch to handle exceptions.
