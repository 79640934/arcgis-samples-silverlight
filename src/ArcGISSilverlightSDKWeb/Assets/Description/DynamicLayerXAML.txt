This sample demonstrates using XAML to specify the LayerDefinitions, LayerDrawingOptions, and DynamicLayerInfos of an ArcGISDynamicMapServiceLayer. The LayerDefinition sets the USCities layer to only show capitals. The LayerDrawingOptions set Layers 0 and 4 to use a SimpleRenderer and Layer 2 to use a ClassBreaksRenderer. The DynamicLayerInfos property is used to add these layers on the fly by setting the Source property to LayerMapSources and a TableDataSource. These properties are applied as the map loads.
