This sample demonstrates adding data in a WebMap document housed via ArcGIS Online (http://www.arcgis.com) in a Silverlight application. The WebMap.GetMapAsync Method call takes a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the WebMap service provided by ArcGIS Online to obtain the geographic data layers. The WebMap’s GetMapCompletedEventArgs.Map.Layers Property is used to obtain all of the individual Layer objects and then add them dynamically to the existing Map Control that was defined in XAML via the Map.LayerCollection.
