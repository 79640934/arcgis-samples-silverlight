This sample demonstrates how to rotate symbols using an attribute value of a feature.  First, define the contents of a MarkerSymbol using a control template.  In this sample the control template contains a Grid with a shape (Path) that forms an arrow.  Use a transform to bind the rotation value of the control to an attribute field in a feature layer.  

Next, reference the marker symbol in a renderer and assign to a feature layer.  The feature layer in this sample references a map service that contains real-time updates for weather data.  Wind direction specifies the true direction FROM which the wind is blowing.  It is normally measured in tens of degrees from 10 degrees clockwise through 360 degrees. North is 360 degrees.  A wind direction of 0 degrees is only used when wind is calm.  Locations where the wind is calm have been removed from this feature layer via the where clause.  Both the station name and wind direction are displayed in a map tip.
