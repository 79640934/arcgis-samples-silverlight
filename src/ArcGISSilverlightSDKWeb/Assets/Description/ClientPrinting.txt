This sample demonstrates how to print a map using the client-side capabilities of Silverlight based on the PrintDocument class.  The PrintDocument object encapsulates the basic logic to print UI elements as they appear on the screen.

Often, in addition to the map, other UI elements such as Border, Header, Footer, ScaleLine, Attribution, etc. are included in a print page.  The MapPrinter control, included in this sample, is used to define the print layout for Silverlight.  

Two notable issues are handled:
1) The map in the main window needs to be cloned to be displayed in the MapPrinter control.
2) Before printing the map, all layers need to be loaded.

The CloneMap class resolves issue 1.  It maintains a Map attached property to define the map to clone in XAML. The MapLoader class resolves issue 2.  It handles the Map.Progress event and fires a MapLoaded event when the map is ready to be printed (for example, all the layers have been loaded).

Note, the actual print area size is known after the user has selected the printer and its properties, such as the page size and orientation.  As a consequence, the map extent may change during the print process.  

Four print templates are included with this sample.  New templates can be added to the 'PrintTemplates' resource dictionary.
