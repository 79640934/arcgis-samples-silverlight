This sample demonstrates techniques for converting renderers, such as SimpleRenderer, UniqueValueRenderer, and ClassBreaksRenderer to and from ArcGIS JSON.  ArcGIS JSON renderers are defined as part of the ArcGIS Server REST API specification: http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/renderer.html.    

Predefined renderers in ArcGIS JSON format are provided.  Feel free to modify the JSON content appropriately and apply to the features in the US States feature layer in the map.   The current tab will always show the current JSON renderer applied to the feature layer.  Use the Reset to Service button to retrieve the renderer defined for the feature layer by the map or feature service.  Note, the maxAllowableOffset property is used to generalize features in the map to improve display performance by reducing the complexity of the geometry.
