This sample demonstrates how to use the length, area, and densify geodesic and Euclidian operations available on the client. To use the sample, click on the shape (either line or polygon) to draw, and select if Geodesic or Euclidean measurements should be made. Draw a shape on the map. If geodesic operations are used, the shape will update to show the geodesic shape between the points you drew. The shape will show any vertices added in the densify operation. In the information box, the length and area (if applicable) of your shape is displayed, as well as the number of vertices present in the both the original and the densified shape.
